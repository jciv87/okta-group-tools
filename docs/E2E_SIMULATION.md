# End-to-End Simulation

Testing the complete user journey from discovery to execution.

## Scenario: New User Discovers the Tool

### Step 1: GitHub Landing Page

**User arrives at:** `https://github.com/jciv87/okta-group-tools`

**First impression:**
```
Okta Group Tools
CLI automation for Okta access management that solves problems the GUI can't.

> Note: I built this for my own work managing Okta at scale. 
  Sharing it in case others find it useful. Use at your own 
  risk and test thoroughly in non-production environments first.
```

**✅ GOOD:** Immediately sets expectations - personal project, use at own risk
**✅ GOOD:** Clear value prop - "solves problems the GUI can't"

**User scrolls down, sees:**
- 6 specific pain points (immutable rules, no undo, bulk ops, etc.)
- 4 tools with use cases
- Architecture diagram
- Setup instructions

**Decision point:** User thinks "This could save me hours" → proceeds to setup

---

### Step 2: Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jciv87/okta-group-tools.git
cd okta-group-tools
```

**User sees files:**
```
README.md          ← Clear instructions
LICENSE            ← MIT, Joe Costanzo
CONTRIBUTING.md    ← "I'm a solo maintainer"
SECURITY.md        ← "Use at your own risk"
package.json       ← v1.0.0
.env.example       ← Template
```

**✅ GOOD:** All community files present and honest

**User runs setup:**
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with their Okta credentials
```

**User runs preflight:**
```bash
npm run preflight
```

**Output:**
```

A tool for managing Group Rules and User Group Memberships.

⚠️  IMPORTANT: This tool modifies production access control
   • All changes are logged and backed up
   • Manifests enable rollback of user access changes
   • You will review changes before they are applied

=== Step 1: Configure Okta Connection ===
Found .env configuration file.

=== Step 2: Select Workflow ===
? What would you like to manage?
  ❯ Direct User Group Assignments (Grant Access)
    Group Rule Assignments
    Reset User Access from a Manifest (Revoke Access)
```

**✅ GOOD:** Safety warning prominent
**✅ GOOD:** Clear workflow options
**✅ GOOD:** Step numbering starts at 1

**User selects:** Direct User Group Assignments

```
=== Step 3: Select User ===
? Enter the user's login or ID: john.doe@company.com
⠋ Searching for user "john.doe@company.com"...
✓ User found.
Operating on user: John Doe (00u1234567890)

=== Step 4: Review Current Memberships ===
⠋ Fetching user's current groups...
✓ Retrieved user groups.

Current Group Memberships:
1. Engineering-Team-Alpha (00g111)
2. DevOps-Staging-Access (00g222)

=== Step 5: Modify Group Assignments ===

You can now select groups to remove from the user.
? Select groups to REMOVE: (Press <space> to select)
  ◯ Engineering-Team-Alpha (00g111)
  ◯ DevOps-Staging-Access (00g222)
```

**✅ GOOD:** Step numbers continue (3, 4, 5)
**✅ GOOD:** Shows current state before changes
**✅ GOOD:** Clear instructions

**User skips removal, proceeds to add:**

```
? How would you like to select groups to ADD?
  ❯ Interactive checklist
    From a text file

? Select groups to ADD: (Press <space> to select)
  ◯ Engineering-Team-Beta (00g333)
  ◉ Security-Audit-ReadOnly (00g555)
  ◯ DevOps-Production-Access (00g444)

=== Step 6: Review and Confirm Changes ===

⚠️  IMPACT SUMMARY
User: john.doe@company.com (John Doe)

Will ADD user to 1 groups:
 - Security-Audit-ReadOnly
   → User will GAIN access granted by these groups

📋 A manifest will be generated for rollback if needed

? Do you want to apply these changes? (Y/n)
```

**✅ GOOD:** Impact summary is clear
**✅ GOOD:** Shows consequences ("will GAIN access")
**✅ GOOD:** Mentions manifest for rollback

**User confirms:** Y

```
=== Step 7: Executing Changes ===
⠋ Adding user to group Security-Audit-ReadOnly...
✓ Added user to group Security-Audit-ReadOnly.

Access change manifest saved to: manifests/manifest-john.doe@company.com-2025-10-17T13-45-00-000Z.json

✓ User group memberships updated successfully!
```

**✅ GOOD:** Progress feedback
**✅ GOOD:** Shows manifest location
**✅ GOOD:** Clear success message

---

### Step 4: Verify Artifacts

**User checks logs:**
```bash
cat logs/okta-wizard.log
```

**Output:**
```json
{"level":"info","message":"Application initialized","action":"init","version":"1.0.0","timestamp":"2025-10-17T13:45:00.000Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"Retrieved groups","action":"list_groups","count":150,"timestamp":"2025-10-17T13:45:05.000Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"Generated revocation manifest","user":"00u1234567890","manifestFile":"manifest-john.doe@company.com-2025-10-17T13-45-00-000Z.json","timestamp":"2025-10-17T13:45:10.000Z"}
```

**✅ GOOD:** Structured logging with timestamps

**User checks manifest:**
```bash
cat manifests/manifest-john.doe@company.com-2025-10-17T13-45-00-000Z.json
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "generatedAt": "2025-10-17T13:45:00.000Z",
  "operator": "admin",
  "user": {
    "id": "00u1234567890",
    "login": "john.doe@company.com"
  },
  "actions": {
    "added": ["00g555"],
    "removed": []
  }
}
```

**✅ GOOD:** Clean manifest structure
**✅ GOOD:** Shows who made the change (operator)

---

### Step 5: Later - Reset Access

**User needs to revoke that temporary access:**

```bash
npm run wizard
```

**Selects:** Reset User Access from a Manifest

```
=== Step 3: Reset User Access from Manifest ===
? Select a manifest to restore:
  ❯ john.doe@company.com - 10/17/2025, 1:45:00 PM
    jane.smith@company.com - 10/16/2025, 3:30:00 PM
    ──────────────
    📁 Enter path manually
```

**✅ GOOD:** Manifest browser works!
**✅ GOOD:** Shows user and timestamp
**✅ GOOD:** Option to enter path manually

**User selects the manifest:**

```
=== Step 4: Review Access Reset Plan ===
⚠️  ACCESS RESET OPERATION
This will restore user john.doe@company.com to the state before 10/17/2025, 1:45:00 PM
This reverses the changes made in that operation.

Will REMOVE user from 1 groups:
 - Security-Audit-ReadOnly

? Do you want to execute this access reset plan? (Y/n)
```

**✅ GOOD:** Clear what will happen
**✅ GOOD:** Shows timestamp of original change

**User confirms:**

```
=== Step 5: Executing Access Reset ===
⠋ Removing user from group Security-Audit-ReadOnly...
✓ Removed user from group Security-Audit-ReadOnly.

✓ User access has been successfully reset to its previous state!
```

**✅ GOOD:** Clean rollback

### Step 6: Bulk Profile Update

**User wants to mark contractors:**

```bash
npm run profile-update
```

**Output:**
