# Contributing

I built this tool for my own use and decided to share it. If you find it useful and want to contribute, great! But please understand:

- **I'm a solo maintainer** - Response times may vary
- **No formal process** - Just open an issue or PR
- **Use at your own risk** - Test thoroughly before using in production

## Found a Bug?

Open an issue with:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Your environment (OS, Node version)
- Relevant logs (redact sensitive info)

## Have an Idea?

Open an issue describing:
- The problem you're trying to solve
- How you'd like it to work
- Why it fits this tool's purpose (bulk operations, safety, auditability)

## Want to Submit Code?

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Test it thoroughly (this manages production access!)
4. Open a PR with a clear description

I may be slow to review, but I appreciate the help.

## Philosophy

This tool exists because the Okta GUI makes certain operations painful:
- Bulk changes
- Immutable rules
- No undo button
- No audit trail

Keep that focus when contributing. Safety first, always.
